### Retrieve List of VM Configuration Files
**VMID** - Every Virtual Machine (VM) has a unique identifying ID number starting at 100 which is located before the name of the VM.  You may have to click on your Node in the resource tree to expand the list.

- **Simple Method**

        qm list

        cat /etc/pve/.vmlist

    **or**

1.      ls /var/lock/qemu-server

### Manually Delete Locked Configuration File
In the case you receive an error while attempting to unlock a VM then the configuration file may have to be deleted.

    rm  /var/lock/qemu-server/lock-<VMID>.conf

Run the unlock command again.

    qm unlock <VMID>
Â 
### Stopping the VM
If for some reason you are able to successfully unlock the VM but are still unable to shut it down or run some other process on it then you can attempt to force stop it
>>>**Follow the directions below at your own discretion and understand that running `qm stop` is like unplugging a computer and can cause data loss.**

    qm stop <VMID>
Â 
### Kill the VM Process
IF ALL ELSE FAILS! - PROCEED WITH CAUTION
**PID** - Process ID is a unique identifier for a particular process in Linux. 

    ps aux | grep "/usr/bin/kvm -id VMID"
    kill -9 <PID>
